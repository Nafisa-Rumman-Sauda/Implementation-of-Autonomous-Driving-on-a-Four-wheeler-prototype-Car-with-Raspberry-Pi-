## Introduction

This collection of Jupyter notebooks demonstrates various computer vision projects aimed at recognizing and interacting with the physical world using visual data. Some projects focus on color detection, object recognition, and QR code reading, while others explore camera integration and autonomous vehicle applications. This repository serves as a practical guide for building and enhancing computer vision systems.

### Key Projects

- **Color Detection**: Identifies and tracks specific colors in images or video streams.
- **Object Recognition**: Detects and classifies objects in images using machine learning models.
- **QR Code Recognition**: Scans and decodes QR codes from images or live video.
- **Camera Driver**: Interfaces with cameras, capturing images or video feeds.
- **Autonomous Driving**: Implementation of full autonomous driving mode on a prototype car using Raspberry Pi.

## Usage

### Running Notebooks

Each project is contained within a Jupyter Notebook. To run them:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the directory:
   ```bash
   cd repository-name
   ```

3. Start Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Open the relevant notebook and run the cells to see the implementation.

### Camera Driver

For projects involving camera integration, make sure your camera is properly set up. The **Camera Driver.ipynb** notebook contains the code to interface with cameras and capture images or video.

### Object Recognition

To run the **Object Recognition.ipynb**, ensure that you have the required models and that your environment is set up with the necessary libraries. The notebook uses pre-trained models or custom models to detect and classify objects in images.

### Autonomous Driving

The **Untitled.ipynb** notebook is dedicated to full autonomous driving mode, implementing algorithms for navigation, obstacle avoidance, and decision-making. This project uses Raspberry Pi to control the prototype car autonomously.
